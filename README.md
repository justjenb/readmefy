## Description

READMEFY automates the process of creating a professional README file for GitHub projects. By asking a series of questions using the Inquirer package, it gathers all the necessary information including descriptions, installation instructions, usage details, licenses, and contact information. The script even allows for the inclusion of multiple images, enhancing the visual appeal and clarity of the README.
